## Lessons

For my first assignment with the updated Odin Project curriculum, I gained foundational skills in web development. I learned how to create an HTML boilerplate, create directories and files, and navigate through the terminal. I also learned how to input headers, paragraphs, images, and links, and how to create ordered and unordered lists for my recipes. Importantly, I practiced organizing my code to be clean and beginner-friendly, ensuring that it is readable and understandable for any viewer. This experience gave me a strong foundation for future web development projects.
